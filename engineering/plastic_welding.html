    <h1>Plastic Welding</h1>
    <p>My flipper partner and I needed a way to weld joints together, and we
      noticed that our school's shop lacked precedent for plastic welding.
      We ordered a designated roll of filament and I made instructions, listed below,
      for the whole class to have access to.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I've actually used this a lot since, and it plays an important role in
      my wind turbine as a coupling agent between the shaft and the generator.</p>

    <h3>Materials & Prep</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Goggles NECESSARY</li>
        <li>Breathe through your shirt or a mask</li>
        <li>Turn on fan or air filter nearby</li>
        <li>Dremel</li>
        <li>2.85mm printing filament (white, found in shop)</li>
        <li>the targeted piece(s)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take all safety precautions above</li>
        <li>Plug in Dremel and set to 15</li>
        <li>Cut short (~1 in.) bit of 2.85mm filament and straighten as much as possible</li>
        <li>Place filament into Dremel slot with ~1/3 of strip in hole</li>
        <li>Hold pieces steady in desired final position while you work (Quick Clamps may help)</li>
        <li>The filament takes a little bit of friction to heat up; slide lightly it around the surface and joint in question</li>
        <li>Once filament starts to readily melt off, continue to slide lightly around joint/break</li>
        <li>HOLDING IN ONE SPOT OR PRESSING HARD WILL MELT THROUGH MATERIALS, ESPECIALLY 3D PRINTS!  Glide lightly over surface</li>
        <li>Continue until weld is smooth, consistent, and solid</li>
      </ol>

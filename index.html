    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm an ice monster that can only survive in sub-freezing temperatures and
      all I do is ice skate.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Just kidding. I'm not an ice monster, my preferred weather is a breezy 60
      degrees, and I barely know how to ice skate.  I am Minnesotan, though.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As I've grown up, I've taken lots of different interests: LEGOs to
      engineering, video games to coding, listening to music to making music. I
      guess I tend to get inspired and enthralled by the things I find
      fascinating.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I get so enthralled, in fact, that I end up losing track of time and
      dedicating a lot of effort to things like constructing a wind
      turbine and building a website (yes, this website). You
      can find some of the things I'm proud of here by clicking the tabs at the
      top.</p>

    <h1>At School</h1>
    <p>In school, I take pride in my work and invest in my learning.  STEM
      classes intrigue me the most; since kindergarten, I've been excited for
      every new topic I learn about physics, chemistry, geology, calculus, and
      basically anything else.  The countless hours I've spent honed in on my
      work in the engineering lab are a testament to my passion and work ethic.
      </p>
    <br>
    <p>I also know how important it is to think about ideas, history, and logic.
      My STEM classes fascinate me the most, but that by no means degrades the
      importance and interest I place in the humanities.  I'm proud of the
      analytical skills I've developed in debate and of the syntheses I've
      formed in essays.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My activities at school have played a major role in my life.  My teams
      mean a lot to me, and I've found a lot of close friends in cross country
      and debate.  I know the importance of community and collaboration in both
      helping one and helping all.</p>

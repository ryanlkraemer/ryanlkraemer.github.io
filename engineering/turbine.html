    <p>When my school announced the self-driven, hands on RED Capstone class
      (Reasearch, Entrepeneurship, and Design), I jumped right on the opportunity.
      This meant I could choose whatever I wanted to innovate, and naturally
      I chose to engineer something. I focused in on renewable energy for this
      project and narrowed it down to wind energy, mostly because of the impact
      it can have on the envrionment, as well as all the fun challenges and
      room for innovation in wintry and urban areas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On the right you can see my prototype.  This is a drag-based model —
      less efficient, because if perfectly designed it can only go as fast as
      the wind, but easier to design.  I plan on transitioning to a lift-based
      model for my final product, as it has various benefits, one being
      efficiency.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You might notice this is a vertical-axis wind turbine, or a VAWT, instead
      of the typical horizontal ones you see on commercial wind farms. This
      style requires a lot less parts because the generator or gear box is
      in line with the axis of rotation.  At smaller wind levels, too, I expect
      it to be more efficient.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This project has required and will require more planning with others,
      specifically experts on wind energy and school and city officials. So far,
      I have consulted with a commercial wind expert, a wind resource analyst,
      and someone who has installed their own turbine. I am just about to start
      talking with officials.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Quick Stats</h3>
    <p>This prototype can currently produce a max of 2.3V in controlled conditions,
      and 1.1V in ambient, gorund-level air. This is before gearing it up; once
      I install a gearbox and put it on the roof where the wind is stronger,
      I expect 12-15V. The holes you see on the MDF plates are how I reduced
      the weight of the turbine by 35%.</p>

    <p>I gave the pitch to my school administration and it was a success. It seems
      that the project can go forward. There are a few more hoops to jump through
      than I anticipated, namely the neighborhood committee that the school is in
      and insurance, but I already heard back that insurance will not be an issue.
      However, I do still plan on adhering to safety standards, of course.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I designed the model pictured to the right of a concept for a lift-based VAWT
      using Solidworks CAD software.
      I read some research and found that the specific blade I used for these, NACA 0015, is the
      best for small lift-based turbines. However, my research also seemed to conclude
      that Savonius (drag-based) designs are overall best for low winds.  This is
      something I would like to research on my own, but it is a bit of a relief because
      Savonius models are easier to manufacture with the resources I have.  I have some
      ideas for innovation of those models as well.</p>

    <p>This quarter, I have half as much time as last in the engineering shop and I
      don't have RED class again until next quarter, but I've been using my free period
      to work on the turbine.  Before I go any further, I just want to note my thanks
      for my teacher and everyone who has supported my project; this has been one of
      the best experiences of my life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With my now more limited time, I've been working on the gearing so that my
      turbine can go from reading a small 1V to much higher limits. I finally got it
      to work today, after many attempts that were simply too complicated for the MDF
      plate I'm working with. I had a lot of problems with resistance and meshing
      before I made the simple solution pictured last in the gallery. I spent a lot of time at first
      working on my preferred gear ratio, ~20:1, with a gear train, but realized I had jumped the gun
      and that I should just make sure I can get something that works.  I now have an
      11.11:1 ratio, and it actually might work for the final product! A lesson learned:
      don't get ahead of myself.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The video at right is of my turbine with the gearing, and
      at its maximum it read over 20V. Feel free to put it in full screen for better
      detail.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 1.67%;">Pictures from various stages of development. The first is the original
        plate with the blade curve, but it broke and I slightly changed it.  It
        utilizes the Golden Spiral. The third from last is one of those moments
        where a shoddy decision turned out to have major benefits — I needed a way
        to couple the shaft to the generator, but I was having a hard time coming up
        with it. I bolted sheet metal to each part, and it helped because of the increased
        flexibility of the metal which decreases friction caused by the shaft pushing
        the red plate towards the wood. The second from last is independent rotation
        in low wind.  The last is the top-view of the 3D model I made for a lift-based
        design.</p>

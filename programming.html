    <h1>My Programming Skills & Story</h1>
      <h3>Languages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It all started when some friends at my elementary school started a
        coding club with the help of our Computer Lab teacher.  I joined because
        it was cool, my friends and I were all doing it together, and because
        I had the typical fantasy of a kid my age who liked video games and
        wanted to make them. I can't say that's still my goal.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I actually learned JavaScript back then from Khan Academy, and while I
        remember a good deal of it now, I can't say I've revisited it.  It did,
        however, set up a base early on for me to have ease learning other
        languages down the line, and I remember certain aspects like
        color-picking.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My favorite text editor is Vim. For HTML and CSS I use Atom.</p>

    <h1>This Website</h1>
    <p>I coded this website from scratch, learning HTML and CSS in what I
      consider a short time (one day) and improving my skills since then. I've had
      a fun time designing it and picking color schemes (you're lucky you
      didn't see some of the other styles). The logo is a cool idea I've had
      sitting in my head for a while, and I'm happy to finally be able to use
      it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I kept in mind mobile-friendliness and other accomodations for the visually
      impaired while writing the code, and I hope you've found it easy to
      navigate.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
    <p>I know basic Java and Python, and am confident in my abilities to learn
      new languages and further my understanding. I got addicted to learning
      Python when the COVID shutdown last spring meant I had less opportunity
      to do physical engineering, and I ended up starting an unfinished
      text-adventure game, which you can find on my GitHub linked at the top. As for
      Java, I'm currently learning it in my AP Computer Science class. I'm confident
      in my ability to apply both to the real world.</p>

    <h1>Robotic Flipper (Semester 2, 2020)</h1>
    <img class ="eng" src="../images/flipper_static.png" type="image/png"></img>
    <p>Cut short by COVID, this project was going to be a flipper for my school's
      team robot. It facilitates going over bumps, stairs, and other uneven terrain.
      If the shutdown didn't happen, my partner and I would have finished this,
      complete with independently spinning treads and about 150 degree rotation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The robot, its flippers, the team, and I would have competed at
      RoboCup Bordeaux, but travel had to be cancelled. I hope we are able to
      make it this coming summer.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Flipper?</h3>
    <p>A flipper is an appendage on the ends of a tread-based robot. It rotates
      up and down to force the robot over bumps.  On our robot, because the treads
      already weren't keyed into the axels on either end, my partner and I planned
      on keying the flippers into the axel so that if the axel rotated, so would
      the flippers.  We would also add onto the existing tread sprockets for the
      flipper treads to attach to so that all treads rotated at the same pace.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <p>Below, you can see all of the versions mentioned. We started with Solidworks
      designs.  There was a competing senior team already on the project, so we
      needed to do something to differentiate our work from theirs.  They had a flat
      plate so that the sprockets and treads were attached on one side, so we designed
      a plate where the sprockets would attach at a different side on each end. We
      did this in an attempt to reduce anticipated flexing in the competing design.
      </p>
    <p>I constructed a wooden prototype while my partner worked on joints to put
      together the pieces for a printed version.  We then made sure that the sprockets
      fit on the prototype before printing the next version. Then as we designed
      sprocket extensions, COVID hit. We had to stop production.</p>
      <br>
      <p>During online
      school, I couldn't stop thinking of ways to improve the design from home,
      so I downloaded Solidworks at home and made the last image, which is a simpler,
      treadless flipper.</p>
